# impDefine
Currently developing... the point is I run into a absolute ton of domains that are identical in some fashion during recon (e.g. Blank Page, Repeated Errors, etc.) the point is just hacking up something that searches the entire output for the exact strings you define and spits out the urls/responses thatdon't include what you provided
